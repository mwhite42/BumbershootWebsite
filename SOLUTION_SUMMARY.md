# Solution Summary: Fixing 404 Errors for Assets on GitHub Pages

## Issue Description

The website was experiencing 404 errors for JavaScript and CSS files when hosted on GitHub Pages:

```
Request URL: https://mwhite42.github.io/website/assets/index-CQeMitoO.js
Status Code: 404 Not Found

Request URL: https://mwhite42.github.io/website/assets/index-Cbu_oY2Q.css
Status Code: 404 Not Found
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, we determined that the problem was related to how GitHub Pages processes and serves static assets. By default, GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to process sites, which can sometimes interfere with how assets are served, especially when:

1. Files have underscores in their names (Jekyll treats these as special)
2. The site has a specific directory structure that Jekyll might interpret differently
3. The site is hosted in a subdirectory of the domain (like username.github.io/website/)

In our case, the build configuration was correct:
- The `vite.config.js` had the correct base path: `base: '/website/'`
- The `package.json` had the correct homepage URL: `"homepage": "https://mwhite42.github.io/website"`
- The assets were being correctly referenced in the HTML with paths like `/website/assets/index-CQeMitoO.js`

However, GitHub Pages' Jekyll processing was likely interfering with how these assets were being served.

## Solution Implemented

To fix the issue, we implemented two key changes:

1. **Added a `.nojekyll` file in the repository root**
   - This tells GitHub Pages not to use Jekyll processing
   - Ensures that the site is served exactly as it's built, without any Jekyll interference

2. **Added a `postbuild` script in `package.json`**
   ```
   "postbuild": "touch dist/.nojekyll"
   ```
   - This automatically creates a `.nojekyll` file in the `dist` directory after each build
   - Ensures that the `.nojekyll` file is included when the site is deployed to GitHub Pages

## Why This Solution Works

The `.nojekyll` file is a special file recognized by GitHub Pages that disables Jekyll processing. By including this file:

1. GitHub Pages will serve all files exactly as they are, without any processing
2. Files with underscores in their names will be served correctly
3. The directory structure will be preserved exactly as it is in the build output
4. Asset paths like `/website/assets/index-CQeMitoO.js` will resolve correctly

This solution is a common practice for modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) deployed to GitHub Pages, as these frameworks often generate build outputs that are not compatible with Jekyll's processing.

## Verification

After implementing these changes and redeploying the site, the assets should load correctly, and the 404 errors should be resolved. You can verify this by:

1. Visiting the site at https://mwhite42.github.io/website
2. Opening the browser's developer console (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
3. Checking the Network tab to ensure that all assets are loading with 200 status codes
